# Xtend Application of Visualization

## Overview

The Xtend Application of Visualization is a project aimed at creating visually engaging representations for various algorithms using React.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project encompasses a wide range of algorithmic visualizations, including sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort. Additionally, it provides step-by-step visualizations for graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

## Key Features

- **Visually Engaging Representations:** The project offers visually appealing representations for algorithms, making complex concepts easier to understand.
  
- **Algorithm Support:** Includes support for a variety of algorithms, including Huffman Coding, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms.
  
- **Step-by-Step Visualizations:** Provides step-by-step visualizations for graph algorithms like BFS and DFS, enabling users to understand the algorithm's operation at each stage.
  
- **Educational Workshops:** Conducted workshops and training sessions to educate educators on effectively leveraging algorithm visualizations for educational purposes.
